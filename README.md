<blockquote>
Simplify dynamic JavaScript UIs with the Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern.
<br/><br/>
By encapsulating data and behavior into a view model, you get a clean, extensible foundation on which to build sophisticated UIs without getting lost in a tangle of event handlers and manual DOM updates.

The New York Times Developer Network<br/>
All the APIs Fit to POST
<br/><br/>
You already know that NYTimes.com is an unparalleled source of news and information. But now it's a premier source of data, too â€” why just read the news when you can hack it?
